Given features:
category_id: identifier of the category of the product
clicks: The number of times this product was clicked
impressions: The number of times this product was shown to users
cpc: the amount of money we get per click
 
Feature extraction:
1.CTR (clicks/impressions)
2.Normalized cpc (averaged within/across category) 
3.Inv : If click = 0(clicks + 1 / impressions), 1 otherwise - for punishing item with zero clicks that 
  was shown a lot and no clicks
4.Normalized profits per view = (cpc * clicks) / impressions (averaged within/across category)
5.Normalized profits = cpc * clicks (averaged within/across category)

Explaination:

-These features were extracted based on relevancy (1,3) and profitability (2,4,5) of the items. The 
idea is rank higher the most relevant and profitable items.
-Feature 2 and 3 can help wth cold start problem

Scoring Process:
1.Split items by category id, 
  justification: 
     -users normally view product per category, 
	 -reduce variance/bias across category - some product category generates more profit, more views
	 -category size impacts views,clicks probability
2.Extract each features that best represent relevancy and profitabiltiy
3.Score is calculated via linear weighted combination averaged with category score (average score of all items in the group). 
The idea is that if two items from different categories achieved equal score then item from category with better average score
should be scored higher. 

Score = ( ((f1 + f2 + f3 + f4 + f5)/5) + catScore)/2

Short comings:
-feature weights are equally assigned, we could empirically analyze more optimized weights
-Category size has a weak negative correlation to the features 
[ctrScore	-0.077575481
invScore	-0.128943035
cpcScore	-0.157505235
profitScore	-0.102242108
ppvScore	-0.109140161]

This needs more analysis and could be added to the feature, e.g. items from smaller categories are more relevant and profitable.

Future improvement:
-collect more data about users to build a user model + user groups
-collect more features about product item 
-extrapolate data from other sources (other websites, calendar), devices, contexts (location)
-consider UI/platform specific features, e.g. within webpage or mobile devices
-include cylic pattern (summer/winter) + temporal pattern of item and user
-optimization with learning to rank (user profile as query -> score as label) to optimize weights
 with cost function
